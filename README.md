# SLIME-DOC-CONTRIBS

This repository contains two different SLIME (The Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs) contribs that extend Common Lisp documentation from Emacs. SLIME-HELP nd SLIME-INFO.

SLIME-HELP is inspired by helpful-mode, but for browsing Common Lisp documentation instead.

SLIME-INFO uses Emacs info-mode for displaying Common Lisp documentation.

## Install

ℹ️ Please consider using [SLIME :star:](https://github.com/mmontone/slime-star), that comes with this extension preinstalled.

Clone this repository using git `--recursive` option, as this repository contains submodules.

Load `swank` and add this repository path to `swank::*load-path*`, in your Lisp compiler init file (~/.sbclrc if using SBCL):

```lisp
(require :swank)
(push #p"/home/marian/src/lisp/slime-doc-contribs/" swank::*load-path*)
```

In Emacs, add this repository path to `load-path` and ddd `slime-help` and `slime-info` to `slime-contribs` in `~/.emacs` init file, like:

```
(push "/home/marian/src/lisp/slime-doc-contribs" load-path)

(setq slime-contribs '(slime-fancy slime-help slime-info))

(slime-setup)
```
